== What is iConquer ==

iConquer is an attempt at creating an online C&C. While this is more a proof of concept and a field of experimentation than an actual, functional, clone, it is usable and I encourage any enthousiast to participate to this project.

It is based on Django and Twisted

== Installation notes ==

Sprites/Images: Because the sprites are taken from C&C, you need to extract them by yourself, or contact me directly to get them. The scripts to generate them is in scripts/ but it is not really user friendly.. Free sprites are welcome :)

You'll need django (1.1, best with 1.2) and twisted

For django, the only requirement is the registration plugin. 

To start the game, Setup your database, change the appropriate config in settings.py and run ./start_server
